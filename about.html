Just two hours from New York City, this stunning mid-century modern house is the perfect getaway from the city, either as a work from home alternative or for a weekend break with friends and family. You will fall in love with the expansive living room located on the main floor which features gorgeous floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a forest. There are three large king-sized bedrooms, so no fighting over who gets the better room! Two full bathrooms right outside, both with shower and one with a bath. Also on the main floor you'll find a fully-equipped kitchen, stocked pantry and BBQ allowing you to make wonderful meals with ease. Off the main room is a large deck overlooking an abundance of greenery. There are multiple spaces to spread out across the 5000 sf which is split between two floors. On the basement level you will find an additional sleeper sofa and full bed with another full bathroom right outside. The main room in the basement has lots of seating and a beautiful wood burning fire - the perfect place for gathering together on those cold nights.

While visiting, take a stroll down to main street which is less than a ten minute walk. There you will find hiking/biking trails, coffee shops, restaurants, gallery, and yoga classes of nearby Hurleyville Arts Centre.
